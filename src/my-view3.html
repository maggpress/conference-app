Not only is Maria in demand as an officiant by couples across the country, but she’s also the founder of the Maine Wedding Network fostering a sense of collaboration and support among professional wedding vendors throughout the state. Whether it’s a discussion by the wood stove in her midcoast cottage or at one of the 20+ weddings she officiates each year, Maria exudes a warmth that draws people in, makes them feel comfortable, and sends them back into the world with a brighter spark in their eye.</p>

A military spouse until her husband Brian transitioned out of the U.S. Navy as an Officer in 2015, Mary Beth has a huge heart and love of our troops and their families and when not working with service members as clients, spends her time volunteering to educate this group.

    <h1>Courtney Wetzel<h1>
    <h4>Blush Bridal & Formal</h4>
    <small>Teaching: Experience Based Business Model at 02:45-03:45 pm</small></center>
    <p>Courtney is a highly motivated, detail oriented entrepreneur with a passion for excellence.  She is known for her big ideas and fearless pursuit of her dreams.  She bought her first bridal shop in Presque Isle, ME in 2011 at age 23 but her vision was always for more! In 2015 she and her husband purchased a historic 3 story former bank building in Bangor and the Blush brand was born.  Just 4 months later, Courtney and her husband purchased an existing women’s clothing and formal wear store in Portland. The Presque Isle and Portland stores were re-branded to carry the Blush name and in December 2016 the Portland location was remodeled to eliminate casual clothing and offer couture wedding gowns. Blush stores are known for their beautiful dresses, over the top service, and carefully designed spaces. Courtney now works from home, focusing on buying, branding, training, and marketing. Leading three stores and over 25 staff members to success has required her to develop efficient systems for duplication and consistency so that the Blush experience touches every customer and so that the brand can continue to grow in the future. Business is a family affair for Courtney, as she and her husband work together daily and are expertly assisted by an adorable 1 1/2 year old son and their Boston Terrier, Lucy.

    <h1>Kate Martin<h1>
    <h4>Beautiful Days</h4></center>
    <p>Owner and Big Chief of Beautiful Days since 2005. Treasure Hunter and Styling Maven at Maine Prop House since 2015.
      Designer, bon vivant, renaissance gal, flower lover and creative adventurer. Seeking beauty, knowledge and inspiration from art, music, food, architecture, interiors and fashion everyday.
      Every Sunday morning my dad would come home with the New York Times. I would go right to the fashion section, followed by arts and leisure eating up all that was “happening” in the world beyond the small island of Nantucket where I grew up. Inevitably my passion for the pretty things and wanderlust led to styling chic window fronts with modern fashion mixed with antique treasures, digging in the dirt of beautiful gardens, ski bumming and photography in Colorado, more photography and adventuring in Central America and interior design in San Francisco. Peppered through out has been alot of live music, off the beaten track diversions, food indulgences and family and friend gatherings.  Ultimately landing in Maine… I love where I live and love what I do.
